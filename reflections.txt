Your response goes here!

I have learnt how to create simple webpages. I have learn about headings, paragraphs, images, links,paths and parent and child elements.
Remembering and using simple html elements has been easy.
It is more difficult to style things using CSS. I found it particularly hard to do the layout (flex box, columns etc) as it is hard to figure out the percentages and really visualise the different boxes on the page.
I have used the problem solving strategy of looking things up pretty well. I consult Mozilla a lot and the CSS tips and tricks page. I also use the code checker that Udacity recommended, this is very helpful because sometimes I have actually gotten the problem ‘right’, but it isn’t loading correctly because there is a mistake in my code.
